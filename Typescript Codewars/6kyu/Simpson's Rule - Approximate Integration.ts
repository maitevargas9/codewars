Description

An integral:
∫ab f(x) dx ∫ ab
​	
f(x)dx
can be approximated by the so-called Simpson’s rule:
b − a 3 n (f(a) + f(b) + 4 ∑ i = 1 n / 2 f(a + (2i − 1) h) + 2 ∑ i = 1 n / 2 − 1 f(a + 2 i h)) 3n b − a (f(a) + f(b) + 4 
∑ i = 1 n/2 f(a + (2i − 1) h) + 2 ∑ i = 1 n / 2 − 1 f(a + 2 i h ))
Here  h = (b - a) / n, n being an even integer and a <= b.

We want to try Simpson's rule with the function f:
f(x) = 32 sin(x) 3 f(x) = 2 3 sin(x) 3
 
The task is to write a function called simpson with parameter n which returns the value of the integral of f on the interval 
[0, pi] (pi being 3.14159265359...).

Notes:
Don't round or truncate your results. See in "RUN EXAMPLES" the function assertFuzzyEquals or testing.
n will always be even.
We know that the exact value of the integral of f on the given interval is 2.
