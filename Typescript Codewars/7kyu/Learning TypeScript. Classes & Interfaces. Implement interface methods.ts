Learning TypeScript. Classes & Interfaces. Implement interface methods

Overview

One of TypeScript’s core principles is that type-checking focuses on the shape that values have. This is sometimes called 
“duck typing” or “structural subtyping”. In TypeScript, interfaces fill the role of naming these types, and are a powerful 
way of defining contracts within your code as well as contracts with code outside of your project.

Task

You are given an interface IGeometricFigure:

interface IGeometricFigure {
  Calculates area of the figure 
  area: () => number;
  Calculates perimeter of the figure 
  perimeter: () => number;
}
Your task is to implement classes Square and Circle:

export class Square implements IGeometricFigure {
  // TODO:
}

export class Circle implements IGeometricFigure {
  // TODO:
}
P.S. Solved this kata? Take a look at other katas in "Learning TypeScript" collection.
*/

interface IGeometricFigure {
  area: () => number;
  perimeter: () => number;
}

export class Square implements IGeometricFigure {
  constructor(public length: number) {}
  area(): number {
    return Math.pow(this.length, 2);
  }
  perimeter(): number {
    return this.length * 4;
  }
}

export class Circle implements IGeometricFigure {
  constructor(public radius: number) {}
  area = (): number => {
    return Math.pow(this.radius, 2) * Math.PI;
  };
  perimeter = (): number => {
    return this.radius * 2 * Math.PI;
  };
}
