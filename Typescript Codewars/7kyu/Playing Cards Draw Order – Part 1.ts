Description

This is Part 1 of this series of two katas — Part 2 is here.
If you like playing cards, have also a look at Hide a message in a deck of playing cards and Card-Chameleon, a Cipher with 
Playing cards.
In this series of two katas, we will draw playing cards from a deck using a particular procedure: after drawing one card, 
we place the next one at the bottom of the deck.

In details, the procedure is:
We draw the top card of the deck.
We take the next card, and put it at the bottom of the deck.
We repeat steps 1 and 2 until there aren't any card left in the deck.

Let's take a small deck containing four cards — named A, B, C, D — as an example:
The deck order is A-B-C-D at the beginning, the card A is at the top and D at the bottom.
A is drawn. The deck is now B-C-D.
B is placed at the bottom of the deck. The deck is now C-D-B.
C is drawn. The deck is now D-B.
D is placed at the bottom of the deck. The deck is now B-D.
B is drawn. The deck is now D.
D is drawn.
The order of the cards drawn is A-C-B-D.

Your task
Write a function accepting a deck of cards as argument, and returning the cards drawn following the procedure.

export const draw = (deck: string[]): string[] => {
Each card is represented with a two-character string: the rank of the card and its suit.

AC 2C 3C 4C 5C 6C 7C 8C 9C TC JC QC KC for the Clubs
AD 2D 3D 4D 5D 6D 7D 8D 9D TD JD QD KD for the Diamonds
AH 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H TH JH QH KH for the Hearts
AS 2S 3S 4S 5S 6S 7S 8S 9S TS JS QS KS for the Spades

A preloaded function allows to easily print a deck to the console:

import { printDeck } from "./preloaded";

printDeck(deck, unicode);
The first argument is the deck to print, the second one is a boolean value allowing the selection of the character set: 
regular or Unicode (for which a font containing the playing cards characters needs to be installed on your system).

Example
const deck = ["KC", "KH", "QC", "KS", "KD", "QH", "QD", "QS"];
draw(deck);
should return:
["KC", "QC", "KD", "QD", "KH", "QH", "KS", "QS"];

Have fun!
I hope you will enjoy this kata! Feedbacks and translations are very welcome.
After this one, jump to Part 2, where we will be ordering the deck to be drawn to have a chosen result!

import { printDeck } from "./preloaded";

export const draw = (deck: string[]): string[] => {
	printDeck(deck, true); // Using unicode characters
	printDeck(deck, false); // Using regular characters

	const drawnCards: string[] = [];

	return drawnCards;
};
*/

import { printDeck } from "./preloaded";

export const draw = (deck: string[]): string[] => {
  let drawnCards: string[] = [];
  let deck2: string[] = deck.slice();
  while (deck2.length) {
    drawnCards.push(deck2.shift()!);
    if (deck2.length) {
      deck2.push(deck2.shift()!);
    }
  }
  return drawnCards;
};
