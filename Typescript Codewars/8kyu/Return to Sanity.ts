/*
Description

This function should return an object, but it's not doing what's intended. What's wrong?

export function mystery(): object {
  const results =
    {sanity: 'Hello'};
  return
    results;
}
*/

export function mystery(): object {
  const results = { sanity: "Hello" };
  return results;
}
