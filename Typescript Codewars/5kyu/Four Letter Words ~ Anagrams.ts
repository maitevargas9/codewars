Our Setup
Alice and Bob work in an office. When the workload is light and the boss isn't looking, they sometimes play simple 
word games for fun. This is one of those days!
However, yesterday Carol and Dan got wise to these sneaky shenanigans ~ and so today surprise challenged them (as 
a team) to one of their own games, which they like to call Anagrams! Alice and Bob reluctantly agreed if all four 
vowed to keep their illicit gamery completely hidden from the rest of the office...

Today's Game
Team_One will be Alice & Bob versus Team_Two who are Carol & Dan, and the fun begins with a list of four-letter 
subject words. Going through the words on this list, the two teams compete in a game of points where one player 
from each team will successively take each other on one round at a time, recalling as many anagrams as possible 
of a subject word from their respective memories, which themselves are also lists of four-letter words.

A Round
Within each round (Alice or Bob) will be matched with (Carol or Dan) in head-on competition over a single subject 
word, attempting to win the round for their team by earning the most round points.
Both players immediately get one (1) round point if they can simply recall the subject word itself from their memory.
Player One recalls as many anagrams of the subject word as they can, getting two (2) round points for each of them.
Player Two may now recall any further anagrams Player One did not know, getting three (3) round points for each.
The player with the highest round score wins the round, and one (1) final point will be contributed to their team's 
final score. If their round scores match, they tie, and no final points are awarded for the round.

The Order
Because the first person to play in a round has the point advantage, The Order of Rounds (as shown below) was 
determined by having the teams take turns where one of their members gets to be first to play, and was then extended 
to give all players at least a chance to eventually compete against both members of their opposing team within a game:
1. Alice Vs Carol
2. Carol Vs Bob
3. Bob   Vs Dan
4. Dan   Vs Alice
5. Alice Vs Dan
6. Carol Vs Alice
7. Bob   Vs Carol
8. Dan   Vs Bob
Because the amount of subject words will vary, each new game will begin with randomly chosen starting opponents, and 
from there continuously rotate through The Order of Rounds (as shown above) until all subject words have been used. 
The players Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dan will be represented by the integers 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, as 
exemplified in the example shown below.

Your Task
To determine a winner by figuring out which team will score the most final points!

Input
subjects
a(n) array / list / tuple / vector of strings
subjects will contain (1<=size<=50) words
memories
a(n) array / list / tuple / vector of the memories of the four players
each memory is a(n) array / list / tuple / vector of strings
all four players will have a memory of the same size at (1<=size<=400)
players
a(n) array / list / tuple / vector of a pairing of integers
contains two (2) of the following integers representing the starting players:
Team One                            Team Two
0    for Alice                      2    for Carol
1    for Bob                        3    for Dan
All strings in this kata will be valid English language  four-letter words.
The subjects list will not contain words that are anagrams of each other.
Words are from a shared source, thus some could appear in multiple lists,
yet the memory and subjects lists will each not contain duplicated words.
Output
An integer:
0    if Team One wins (Alice & Bob)
1    if Team Two wins (Carol & Dan)
-1   if neither win because they tie
An Example
subjects = ('darb', 'bust', 'spot', 'calo', 'oaky', 'mite',
            'meta', 'tael', 'gore', 'elan', 'code', 'demo')
alice = ('gore', 'stop', 'emit', 'tame', 'mode',
         'cola', 'drab', 'ergo', 'dome', 'bard',
         'okay', 'loca', 'stub', 'goer', 'coal')
bob   = ('lean', 'tela', 'stop', 'leat', 'code',
         'pots', 'coed', 'post', 'buts', 'tale',
         'stub', 'spot', 'tame', 'meat', 'mate')
carol = ('brad', 'tame', 'okay', 'bust', 'time',
         'lane', 'item', 'mate', 'ergo', 'darb',
         'tubs', 'team', 'gore', 'ogre', 'meta')
dan   = ('coal', 'oaky', 'tops', 'mode', 'spot',
         'code', 'demo', 'calo', 'teal', 'opts',
         'deco', 'cola', 'tale', 'kayo', 'late')
memories = (alice, bob, carol, dan)
players  = (0, 2)  #  this game begins with Alice Vs Carol
Nota Bene: there are twelve possible scoring scenarios for this game, all of which have been represented once each 
(out of order) within the twelve rounds of this comprehensive example
The game begins with Alice of Team One going first against Carol of Team Two. In this particular case, only Carol 
happens to know the subject word, but because their round scores match, there is no change to the final score.
Round One ~ "darb"
Scenario 9 (second knows subject, players tie)
Alice    4 round points    2 each for "bard", "drab"
Carol    4 round points    1 for knowing "darb"
                           3 for knowing "brad"
[0, 0] teams are tied
Following The Order of Rounds, Carol will now get to go first in taking on Bob. Bob is representing Team One which 
now must go in second place, but since he knows enough anagrams of the subject word, he wins the round for Team One.
Round Two ~ "bust"
Scenario 5 (first knows subject, second wins)
Carol    3 round points    1 for knowing "bust"
                           2 for knowing "tubs"
Bob      6 round points    3 each for "buts", "stub"
[1, 0] Team One winning
Here both players know a lot of anagrams, but they still happen to tie the round.
Round Three ~ "spot"
Scenario 3 (both know subject, players tie)
Bob      7 round points    1 for knowing "spot"
                           2 each for "post", "pots", "stop"
Dan      7 round points    1 for knowing "spot"
                           3 each for "opts", "tops"
[1, 0] Team One winning
Dan from Team Two finally gets to go first, bringing the score back to a tie by beating Alice.
Round Four ~ "calo"
Scenario 4 (first knows subject, first wins)
Dan      5 round points    1 for knowing "calo"
                           2 each for "coal", "cola"                
Alice    3 round points    3 for knowing "loca"
[1, 1] teams are tied
A feisty Dan, this time following Alice, manages to grab a second win in a row from her, now putting Team Two in the 
lead.
Round Five ~ "oaky"
Scenario 8 (second knows subject, second wins)
Alice   2 round points    2 for knowing "okay"
Dan     4 round points    1 for knowing "oaky"
                          3 for knowing "kayo"
[1, 2] Team Two winning
Now Carol will continue the hot run of Team Two beating poor Alice yet again by just edging her out for another round.
Round Six ~ "mite"
Scenario 10 (neither knows subject, first wins)
Carol    4 round points    2 each for "item", "time"
Alice    3 round points    3 for knowing "emit"
[1, 3] Team Two winning
Bob reverses the energy by clawing out a win for Team One in this round by knowing a lot of anagrams for "meta" although without actually knowing "meta" itself.
Round Seven ~ "meta"
Scenario 7 (second knows subject, first wins)
Bob      6 round points    2 each for "mate", "meat", "tame"
Carol    4 round points    1 for knowing "meta"
                           3 for knowing "team"
[2, 3] Team Two winning
Both players struggle here for a victory, but the round results in a tie, with Team Two holding onto the lead.
Round Eight ~ "tael"
Scenario 12 (neither knows subject, players tie)
Dan      6 round points    2 each for "late", "tale", "teal"
Bob      6 round points    3 each for "leat", "tela"
[2, 3] Team Two winning
This time Alice finally gets some revenge against Carol, evening out the final score.
Round Nine ~ "gore"
Scenario 1 (both know subject, first wins)
Alice    5 round points    1 for knowing "gore"
                           2 each for "ergo", "goer"
Carol    4 round points    1 for knowing "gore"
                           3 for knowing "ogre"
[3, 3] teams are tied
Although neither player can muster much muck against the subject word "elan", Bob nonetheless furthers the current 
winning rally for Team One, and takes them back into the lead.
Round Ten ~ "elan"
Scenario 11 (neither knows subject, second wins)
Carol    2 round points    2 for knowing "lane"
Bob      3 round points    3 for knowing "lean"
[4, 3] Team One winning
In this penultimate round, Dan manages to bring some hope of victory to Team Two by leveling the score with only 
one subject word to go!
Round Eleven ~ "code"
Scenario 2 (both know subject, second wins)
Bob      3 round points    1 for knowing "code"
                           2 for knowing "coed"
Dan      4 round points    1 for knowing "code"
                           3 for knowing "deco"
[4, 4] teams are tied
With the final round upon us, Dan gets to go first and also knows the subject word but otherwise not enough anagrams 
to get any more points than Alice can. Being tied going into and also for the final round, the outcome of the game 
itself results in a tie.
Round Twelve ~ "demo"
Scenario 6 (first knows subject, players tie)
Dan      3 round points    1 for knowing "demo"
                           2 for knowing "mode"
Alice    3 round points    3 for knowing "dome"
[4, 4] teams are tied
