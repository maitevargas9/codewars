Description

We have a square matrix M of dimension n x n that has positive and negative numbers in the ranges [-9,-1] and [0,9],
(the value 0 is excluded).

We want to add up all the products of the elements of the diagonals UP-LEFT to DOWN-BOTTOM, that is the value ofsum1; 
and the elements of the diagonals UP-RIGHT to LEFT-DOWN and that is sum2. Then, as a final result, the value of sum1 - sum2.

E.g.
M = [[ 1,  4, 7,  6,  5],
[-3,  2, 8,  1,  3],
[ 6,  2, 9,  7, -4],
[ 1, -2, 4, -2,  6],
[ 3,  2, 2, -4,  7]]

Let's see how to get this result in the image below:

So the value of sum1 - sum2 is equal to:
1164 - 66 = 1098
Create the code to do this calculation.

Features of the random tests:
Numbers of tests = 150
5 <= dimension <= 25 (python, ruby and COBOL)
5 <= dimension <= 20 (javascript)
-10 < M[i,j] < 0 and 0 < M[i,j] < 10

This kata is available in Python2, Ruby, Typescript, D, Cobol, Julia, Rust and Javascript at the moment. 
Translations into another languages will be released soon. Enjoy it!
