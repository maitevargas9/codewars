Description

Task
Compute the Mobius function Î¼(n) for a given value of n.
For a given n, the Mobius function is equal to:
0 if n is divisible by the square of any prime number. For example n = 4, 8, 9 are all divisible by the square of at 
least one prime number.
1 if n is not divisible by the square of any prime numbers, and has an even number of prime factors. For example 
n = 6, 10, 21 satisfy these conditions (e.g. 21 = 3 * 7 so it has an even number (2) of distinct prime factors 
and is not divisible by the square of any prime numbers).
-1 otherwise. For example n = 3, 5, 7, 30.

Input/Output
You will be given an integer n; you must return an integer - the Mobius function of n.
Performance requirements:
2 <= n <= 1e12
