-- Desciption
-- For this challenge you need to create a basic Age Calculator function which calculates the age 
-- in years on the age field of the peoples table.
-- The function should be called agecalculator, it needs to take 1 date and calculate the age in 
-- years according to the date NOW and must return an integer.
-- You may query the people table while testing but the query must only contain the function on your final submit.
-- people table schema id name age
-- NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.

CREATE FUNCTION agecalculator(age DATE)
RETURNS INT AS $$
  BEGIN
  RETURN DATE_PART('YEAR', AGE(age));
  END; $$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
