-- Description
-- You are a data analyst at a subscription-based e-learning platform. It allows users to book courses in advance, 
-- and the platform keeps track of both the booking date and the course start date. Management has tasked you with 
-- analyzing how many "active bookings" exist on each booking_date.
-- Write an SQL query to calculate the number of active bookings for each booking_date in the system. The results 
-- should include all booking_date values from the course_bookings table, and the count of active bookings for each.
-- course_bookings table:
-- id (int, primary key): Unique identifier for the booking.
-- course_id (int, foreign key) Identifier for the course.
-- user_id (int): Identifier for the user who booked the course.
-- course_start_date (date): The date when the course is scheduled to start.
-- booking_date (date): The date when the user booked the course.
-- An "active booking" is defined as a course booking that:
-- Was booked on or before a given booking_date.
-- Has a course_start_date that is on or after the booking_date, meaning it has not yet started.
-- Resultant columns:
-- booking_date: the date on which bookings were made
-- active_bookings: the count of all active bookings
-- The result is ordered by booking_date in ascending order.
-- For this sample data:
-- | id | course_id | user_id | course_start_date | booking_date |
-- +----+-----------+---------+-------------------+--------------+
-- | 1  | 101       | 1       | 2025-01-01        | 2025-01-01   |
-- | 2  | 102       | 2       | 2025-01-06        | 2025-01-01   |
-- | 3  | 102       | 3       | 2025-01-06        | 2025-01-01   |

-- | 6  | 105       | 6       | 2025-01-09        | 2025-01-04   |
-- | 7  | 106       | 7       | 2025-01-10        | 2025-01-05   |
-- | 8  | 106       | 8       | 2025-01-10        | 2025-01-05   |
-- | 9  | 106       | 9       | 2025-01-10        | 2025-01-05   |
-- | 10 | 106       | 10      | 2025-01-10        | 2025-01-05   |
-- | 11 | 106       | 11      | 2025-01-10        | 2025-01-05   |
-- | 12 | 107       | 12      | 2025-01-11        | 2025-01-05   |
-- expected output is the following:
-- | booking_date | active_bookings |

-- 2025-01-01: 3 bookings are active (IDs: 1, 2, 3).
-- 2025-01-02: 3 bookings are active (IDs: 2, 3, 4) because ID 1 is no longer active (it started on 2025-01-01).
-- 2025-01-03: 4 bookings are active (IDs: 2, 3, 4, 5).
-- 2025-01-04: 5 bookings are active (IDs: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
-- 2025-01-05: 11 bookings are active (IDs: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12).
