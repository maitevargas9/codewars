-- Description
-- You are given a table called customer_purchases that contains information about customer purchases. 
-- You are required to write an SQL query to find the number of new unique customers (as num_new_customers column) on each date.
-- A new customer is defined as one making their first purchase.
-- Table schema
-- customer_id (integer) - The unique identifier for each customer
-- date (date) - The date of the purchase
-- product (varchar) - The product purchased by the customer
-- Here's an example of what the data table might look like:
-- customer_id |    date    | product
-- ------------+------------+----------
      1     | 31-08-2023 | Orange
      1     | 31-08-2023 | Orange
      3     | 31-08-2023 | Apple
      1     | 24-09-2023 | Apple
      4     | 25-09-2023 | Orange
-- The result should be:
--     date     | num_new_customers |
-- -------------+--------------------
--  31-08-2023  | 2                 |
--  25-09-2023  | 1                 |
-- Resultant query should be ordered by date in ascending order

SELECT date, COUNT(*) AS num_new_customers
FROM (
  SELECT date, customer_id, 
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY date) AS row_number
  FROM customer_purchases 
  ) AS ranked_puches
WHERE row_number = 1
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date;
