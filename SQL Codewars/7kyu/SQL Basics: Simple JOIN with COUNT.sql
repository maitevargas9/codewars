-- Description
-- For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement that will return all columns from the people table, 
-- and join to the toys table so that you can return the COUNT of the toys
-- people table schema id name
-- toys table schema id name people_id
-- You should return all people fields as well as the toy count as "toy_count".
-- NOTE Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.
SELECT
    p.id,
    p.name,
    COUNT(t.name) AS toy_count
FROM
    people AS p
    LEFT JOIN toys AS t ON p.id = t.people_id
GROUP BY
    p.id,
    p.name;
