-- Description
-- Write a query to produce a result set that lists an array of student names (ordered by their student_id in 
-- ascending order) for each subject where these students achieved the highest mark for that subject. 
-- Your result should also include the subject name and the highest mark achieved.
-- Table Schema:
-- students:
-- student_id (integer) - Unique identifier for each student.
-- student_name (varchar) - Name of the student.
-- details (varchar) - Additional details related to the student (for this challenge, it may have a static value like 'X').
-- subjects:
-- subject_id  (varchar) - Unique identifier for each subject (e.g., 'M' for Math).
-- subject_name (varchar) - Name of the subject (e.g., 'Math', 'English').
-- marks:
-- student_id (integer) - Identifier linking to the students table.
-- subject_id (varchar) - Identifier linking to the subjects table.
-- mark_rate (integer) - The mark or score the student has received for the subject.
-- Resultant Dataset Columns:
-- student_names (varchar[]) - Array of student names who scored the top mark for a subject, ordered by their student ID in ascending order.
-- subject_name (varchar) - Name of the subject.
-- mark_rate (integer) - The highest mark achieved in the subject.
-- The result set should be ordered by the subject_id in ascending order.
-- Desired Output
-- ​The desired output should look like this: ​
-- student_names  subject_name	mark_rate
-- {Paul,Lukas}	  English	    100
-- {George}	      History	    98
-- {John}	      Math	        95
