-- Description
-- Background Story:
-- At Bapple company, a recent review of shipment reports uncovered a significant issue: many sales were linked to addresses that didn't 
-- match the purchasing customer's details. Delving deeper, it was found that two specific problems were prevalent. First, some customers 
-- had made purchases using addresses that didn't correspond to any on their accounts, indicating the use of incorrect or unrelated 
-- addresses. Secondly, and perhaps more troubling, was the discovery that a subset of customers had no address on file at all, yet had 
-- successfully completed transactions.
-- This situation presented a unique opportunity for the CEO, who decided to focus on those customers who spent $199 or more. He reasoned 
-- that these higher-spending customers would be more engaged and might welcome further interaction, especially when contacted about the 
-- address discrepancies. However, this approach meant neglecting those who spent less, which brought an ethical dimension to the strategy. 
-- Despite this, the CEO's plan was clear: to turn this logistical error into a sales opportunity, prioritizing customers who showed a greater 
-- potential for future business.
-- Tast Description:
-- We have the following DB schema:
-- customers:
-- customerid (int): The unique identifier for each customer.
-- email (varchar): The email address of the customer.
-- addresses:
-- addressid (int): The unique identifier for each address.
-- customerid (int): Foreign key that references customerid in the customers table. Indicates which customer an address belongs to.
-- address (varchar): The street address.
-- city (varchar): The city of the address.
-- state (char): The state of the address.
-- zipcode (varchar): The zipcode of the address.
-- sales:
-- salesid (int): The unique identifier for each sale.
-- customerid (int): Foreign key that references customerid in the customers table. Indicates which customer made the sale.
-- addressid (int, nullable): Foreign key that references addressid in the addresses table. Indicates the address used for the sale.
-- itemdescription (varchar): Description of the item sold.
-- price (float): The price of the item sold.
-- salesreps:
-- salesrepid (int): The unique identifier for each sales representative.
-- firstname (varchar): The first name of the sales representative.
-- lastname (varchar, nullable): The last name of the sales representative.
-- hiredate (datetime): The date when the sales representative was hired.
-- Objective: Create a report identifying customers who either used an incorrect address or have no address on file, with purchases totaling 
-- $199 or more.
-- Incorrect Address: This refers to instances where the address linked to a customer's purchase in the sales table does not match any address 
-- associated with that customer in the addresses table. It indicates a mismatch, suggesting the customer might have inadvertently or 
-- intentionally used an address that is not theirs.
-- No Address on File: This means that the customer has made purchases but does not have any associated address in the addresses table. In 
-- essence, these customers have completed transactions without providing or selecting a valid address for shipment.
-- Assignment of Sales Reps:
-- There are 3 sales representatives in the company.
-- The goal is to distribute the identified customers among these reps as evenly as possible.
-- "As evenly as possible" means that each sales rep should have a roughly equal number of customers to contact.
-- Prioritize reps with earlier hire dates (ascending order of hiredate) when assigning customers. If the first rep can be assigned a customer, they should be; if not, move to the next rep in seniority, and so on. We can be sure that there are no reps with the same hiredate.
-- Email Scripts:
-- Two different scripts are required for the sales reps based on the customer's address status:
-- For customers with an address: "You've spent enough money with us so we care about your business. Unfortunately you have selected a bad 
-- address. Please login to our site and select a good address."
-- For customers without an address: "You've spent enough money with us so we care about your business. You don't have an address on file yet 
-- you've selected an address. Please login to our site and add an address so we may use it... Don't ask any questions on how this happened."
-- Expected Output for the Report:
-- email (varchar): This column should display the email address of the customer. It is used to identify each customer uniquely and as a means 
-- of contact for the sales reps.
-- total_bought (float): This column represents the total dollar amount of products purchased by the customer. It is calculated as the sum of 
-- all purchases made by the customer that meet the criteria (total purchases of $199 or more).
-- rep_name (varchar): This column displays the name of the sales representative assigned to contact the customer. The name should be formatted 
-- as 'firstname lastname'. If there is no last name (it can be either empty string or null), only the first name should be displayed with no 
-- trailing space.
-- script (varchar): This column contains the script that the sales representative is to use in the email to the customer. The script varies 
-- based on whether the customer has an incorrect address or no address on file. It provides tailored instructions to the customer for 
-- correcting their address information.
-- The primary ordering of the report should be based on the total_bought column in descending order. This ensures that customers who spent 
-- the most are listed first. In case of a tie in the total_bought values, use the email column (in ascending alphabetical order) as a 
-- secondary ordering criterion.
-- Desired Output
-- The desired output should look like this:
-- email	total_bought	rep_name	script
