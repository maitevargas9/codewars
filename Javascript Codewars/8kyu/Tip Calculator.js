Description

Complete the function, which calculates how much you need to tip based on the total amount of the bill and the service.

You need to consider the following ratings:
Terrible: tip 0%
Poor: tip 5%
Good: tip 10%
Great: tip 15%
Excellent: tip 20%

The rating is case insensitive (so "great" = "GREAT"). If an unrecognised rating is received, then you need to return:
"Rating not recognised" in Javascript, Python and Ruby...
...or null in Java
...or -1 in C#
Because you're a nice person, you always round up the tip, regardless of the service.

function calculateTip(amount, rating) {
  var rate = rating.toLowerCase();

  if (rate === "excellent") {
    return Math.ceil((amount * 20) / 100);
  } else if (rate === "great") {
    return Math.ceil((amount * 15) / 100);
  } else if (rate === "good") {
    return Math.ceil((amount * 10) / 100);
  } else if (rate === "poor") {
    return Math.ceil((amount * 5) / 100);
  } else if (rate === "terrible") {
    return Math.ceil((amount * 0) / 100);
  } else {
    return "Rating not recognised";
  }
