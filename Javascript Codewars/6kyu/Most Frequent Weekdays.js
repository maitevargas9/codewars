Description

What is your favourite day of the week? Check if it's the most frequent day of the week in the year.

You are given a year as integer (e. g. 2001). You should return the most frequent day(s) of the week in that year. 
The result has to be a list of days sorted by the order of days in week (e. g. ['Monday', 'Tuesday'], ['Saturday', 'Sunday'], 
['Monday', 'Sunday']). Week starts with Monday.

Input: Year as an int.
Output: The list of most frequent days sorted by the order of days in week (from Monday to Sunday).

Preconditions:
Week starts on Monday.
Year is between 1583 and 4000.
Calendar is Gregorian.

Examples (input -> output):
* 2427 -> ['Friday']
* 2185 -> ['Saturday']
* 2860 -> ['Thursday', 'Friday']
