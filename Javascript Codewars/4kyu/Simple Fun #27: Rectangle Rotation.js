Description

Task

A rectangle with sides equal to even integers a and b is drawn on the Cartesian plane. Its center (the intersection point of 
its diagonals) coincides with the point (0, 0), but the sides of the rectangle are not parallel to the axes; instead, they 
are forming 45 degree angles with the axes.

How many points with integer coordinates are located inside the given rectangle (including on its sides)?

Example
For a = 6 and b = 4, the output should be 23

Input/Output
[input] integer a
A positive even integer.
Constraints: 2 ≤ a ≤ 10000.
[input] integer b
A positive even integer.
Constraints: 2 ≤ b ≤ 10000.
[output] an integer
The number of inner points with integer coordinates.
