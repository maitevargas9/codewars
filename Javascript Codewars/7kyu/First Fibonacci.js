What is the Fibonacci sequence
The Fibonacci sequence starts with the numbers 0 and 1, and every next number is given by adding the previous two together. 
So 0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, etc.

The challenge
Your challenge is, given two consecutive numbers in a Fibonacci-like sequence (where the next number is found by adding the 
two previous numbers), to find the lowest possible non-negative numbers that the sequence originates from. For example, if 
you are given the numbers 398 and 644, which come from this sequence:
2, 6, 8, 14, 22, 36, 58, 94, 152, 246, 398, 644
Then you would return 2 and 6, as they are the numbers which started the sequence.

Note that 8 and 14, while they also start a sequence containing 398 and 644, are not correct as they are not the lowest 
possible sequence start.

Note
For the purposes of this puzzle, Fibonacci-like sequences don't decrease. This means that the following sequence is not 
considered Fibonacci-like, and 4 and 2 are NOT solutions to the puzzle:
4, 2, 6, 8, 14, 22, 36, 58, 94, 152, 246, 398, 644

function solution(first, second) {
  while (true) {
    const prev = second - first;

    if (prev < 0 || prev > first) {
      break;
    }

    second = first;
    first = prev;
  }

  return [first, second];
}
