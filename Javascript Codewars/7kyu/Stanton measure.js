/*
Description

The Stanton measure of an array is defined as follows:
Let n be the number of times the value 1 appears in the array.
The Stanton measure is then the number of times n appears in the array.

Task
Write a function that takes an integer array and returns its Stanton measure.

Examples
For [1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2]:
1 appears 2 times → 2 appears 3 times → Stanton measure = 3.
For [1, 4, 1, 2, 11, 2, 3, 1]:
1 appears 3 times → 3 appears 1 time → Stanton measure = 1.

function stantonMeasure(a) {
  const n = a.filter((x) => x === 1).length;
  return a.filter((x) => x === n).length;
}
