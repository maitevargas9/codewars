#Bubbleing around

Since everybody hates chaos and loves sorted lists we should implement some more sorting algorithms. 
Your task is to implement a Bubble sort (for some help look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) 
and return a list of snapshots after each change of the initial list.

e.g.

If the initial list would be l=[1,2,4,3] my algorithm rotates l[2] and l[3] and after that it adds [1,2,3,4] 
to the result, which is a list of snapshots.

[1,2,4,3] should return [ [1,2,3,4] ]
[2,1,4,3] should return [ [1,2,4,3], [1,2,3,4] ]
[1,2,3,4] should return []
*/

function bubble(arr) {
  const result = [];
  let swapped;

  do {
    swapped = false;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
      if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
        [arr[i], arr[i + 1]] = [arr[i + 1], arr[i]];
        swapped = true;
        result.push([...arr]);
      }
    }
  } while (swapped);

  return result;
}
