Description

Escape the room

You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table ( dict in Python) called rooms that contains 
all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each room being a hash table with at least 3 properties 
(e.g. name, description, completed).
