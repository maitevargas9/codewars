Description

Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. 
Index 0 will be considered even.

For example, capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']. See test cases for more examples.

The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces.

Good luck!
